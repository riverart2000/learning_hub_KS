   - Unique ids (e.g., "algebra", "geometry")
   - Names that are specific topics within the main category
   - Descriptions (one sentence each)
3. Create 2 learning units (one per subcategory) with:
   - Unique ids matching the subcategory names (e.g., "algebra")
   - type: ALWAYS "mixed"
   - difficulty: use "beginner"
   - Relevant tags
4. Create 30 questions PER subcategory with:
   - Sequential ids (q1, q2, q3, ... q100)
   - Each question linked to the appropriate learning unit
   - Clear, concise questions
   - Accurate correct answers
   - Helpful hints 
   - Detailed explanations of the correct answer(2-3 sentences)
   - Appropriate difficulty level ("beginner")
