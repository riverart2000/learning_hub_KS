      "explanation": "‘Śāmbhavopāya’ is a Sanskrit compound: *Śāmbhava* (pertaining to Śambhu, i.e., Śiva) + *upāya* (means or method). It signifies the path rooted in pure Śiva-consciousness.",

      "explanation": "Traditionally, there are four upāyas: Śāmbhavopāya, Śāktopāya, Āṇavopāya, and Anupāya (the 'no-method' beyond method). Śāmbhavopāya is supreme as it relies solely on Śiva’s will (*icchā*).",

      "explanation": "In lower upāyas, *ādhāra* may be breath or mantra. In Śāmbhavopāya, the only *ādhāra* is *svayaṃprakāśa cit*—self-luminous consciousness—requiring no external anchor.",
