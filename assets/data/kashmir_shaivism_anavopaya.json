      "correctAnswer": "The path of the individual or embodied method",
      "hint": "Think about the root 'āṇu' which refers to the limited self.",
      "explanation": "Āṇavopāya derives from 'āṇu' meaning the atomic or individual self, emphasizing practices that start from the limited, embodied state. It is the lowest of the upāyas but essential for beginners to gradually transcend duality. This path uses the body and action as gateways to higher realization.",

      "correctAnswer": "Āṇavopāya",
      "hint": "It focuses on physical and gross levels of experience.",
      "explanation": "Āṇavopāya is the foundational path for those deeply identified with the body and senses. It prepares the practitioner by purifying gross impurities before advancing to subtler methods. Despite being 'lowest,' it is equally valid for achieving liberation when practiced with devotion.",

      "correctAnswer": "Action and the embodied individual",
      "hint": "It involves kriyā-śakti, the power of doing.",
      "explanation": "Āṇavopāya centers on kriyā-śakti, using physical actions, breath, and body to awaken consciousness. This approach makes spirituality accessible by starting from everyday experiences. It transforms ordinary activities into sacred practices leading to Shiva-realization.",

      "explanation": "The four upāyas are Āṇavopāya (individual), Śāktopāya (energy), Śāmbhavopāya (will), and Anupāya (no means). Each suits different levels of readiness, with Āṇavopāya being the most gradual. This structure ensures all can progress toward non-dual awareness.",

      "hint": "It symbolizes contraction from universal consciousness.",
      "explanation": "'Āṇu' refers to the contracted, limited aspect of consciousness due to āṇavamala (innate impurity). Āṇavopāya works to expand this limitation back to fullness. Understanding āṇu helps practitioners recognize their divine potential within apparent finitude.",

      "explanation": "Samāveśa means complete absorption into divine consciousness, dissolving the sense of separation. Āṇavopāya achieves this through embodied means, proving no path is inferior. This non-dual goal unifies all practices in Kashmir Shaivism.",

      "hint": "It's the fundamental contraction of consciousness.",
      "explanation": "Āṇavamala is the core impurity causing individuality and ignorance of one's Shiva-nature. Āṇavopāya purifies it via action-oriented practices. Removing this leads to freedom from other mal as like mayiya and karma.",

      "explanation": "Kriyā-śakti is Shiva's creative power manifested in individual actions like rituals and yoga. In Āṇavopāya, it drives embodied techniques to reveal inner divinity. Harnessing it turns mundane efforts into paths of liberation.",

      "correctAnswer": "Āṇavopāya leads to pratyabhijñā through practice",
      "hint": "Pratyabhijñā is recognition of self as Shiva.",
      "explanation": "Pratyabhijñā means 'recognition' of one's innate divinity, which Āṇavopāya facilitates via purifying actions. Practices remove veils, allowing spontaneous insight. Thus, embodied effort culminates in direct self-knowledge.",

      "hint": "They obscure the vision of unity.",
      "explanation": "These mal as—innate limitation, illusion of difference, and action-bondage—contract consciousness. Āṇavopāya targets them sequentially starting with āṇavamala. Purification restores the natural state of freedom.",

      "hint": "It encompasses the triad of energies.",
      "explanation": "Trika means 'three,' symbolizing the interplay of Shiva (transcendent), Shakti (immanent), and the individual (nara). Āṇavopāya integrates the individual into this unity. This framework underpins all Shaiva practices.",

      "hint": "It bridges the gap between individual and universal.",
