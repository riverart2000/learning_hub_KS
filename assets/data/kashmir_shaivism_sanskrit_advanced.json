      "correctAnswer": "Pratyabhijñā",
      "hint": "Consider the process of realizing one's identity with Shiva through direct insight.",
      "explanation": "Pratyabhijñā, meaning 'recognition,' is the philosophical system developed by Utpaladeva that emphasizes spontaneous self-recognition as the path to liberation. It posits that ignorance is forgetting one's divine nature, remedied by intellectual and contemplative recognition. This doctrine integrates epistemology and ontology in the Trika tradition.",

      "correctAnswer": "The pulsation or vibration of consciousness",
      "hint": "Think of the dynamic throb that underlies all phenomena without dual separation.",
      "explanation": "Spanda refers to the subtle vibration or pulsation of Shiva's consciousness, which is the cause of the universe's appearance and dissolution. As per the Spanda Karikas, this vibration is neither creation nor destruction but the free play of divine energy. It bridges static being and dynamic becoming in non-dual Shaivism.",

      "hint": "Recall the three levels of Shakti that encompass all reality.",
      "explanation": "In Trika Shaivism, Para Shakti is the pure, transcendent will of Shiva; Apara Shakti governs the limited, objective world; and Parapara Shakti mediates as the creative, immanent power. This triad unifies the absolute and relative, preventing dualistic fragmentation. It forms the basis for understanding non-dual manifestation.",

      "hint": "They represent the progressive contraction from pure consciousness to material form.",
      "explanation": "The 36 Tattvas outline the emanation from Shiva-Shakti unity to the material world, with pure Tattvas embodying transcendence, pure-impure introducing limitation, and impure detailing cosmic evolution. This schema, detailed in texts like Tantraloka, illustrates non-dual descent without true separation. It aids in meditative ascent back to the absolute.",

      "explanation": "Anuttara, meaning 'unsurpassed,' is the ineffable ground of being in Shaiva ontology, free from all limitations and dualities.

      "explanation": "Iccha Shakti is the supreme will of Shiva that freely chooses to manifest the universe out of playful abundance, not necessity.

      "explanation": "Abhasavada posits that all phenomena are reflections or appearances (abhasas) of Shiva's self-luminous consciousness, maintaining non-duality. Utpaladeva uses this to refute external realism, showing objects as dependent on the subject's awareness. It underpins meditative practices of subject-object unity.",

      "explanation": "Svatantrya denotes Shiva's unrestricted sovereignty, allowing the universe to arise as an expression of infinite freedom. In Trika, it integrates with Spanda as the basis for non-dual causality. Realizing Svatantrya dissolves the illusion of bondage.",

      "hint": "Their unity is the essence of all existence.",
      "explanation": "In Kashmir Shaivism, Shiva is the transcendent subject, Shakti the immanent energy; their inseparability means creation is Shiva's self-expression. This avoids dualism, portraying the cosmos as a vibrant unity. Practices like nyasa invoke this integration.",

      "explanation": "Prakasha is Shiva's pure illumination, while Vimarsha is the dynamic self-recognition that objectifies it, forming the basis of manifestation. Abhinavagupta describes this as the 'throb' of consciousness. Their union prevents inertness in the absolute.",

      "hint": "These introduce limitations in the pure-impure category.",
      "explanation": "The Kanchukas (sheaths) veil pure consciousness, fragmenting it into limited agency, knowledge, desire, temporality, and order. They bridge transcendent and empirical realms in Shaiva cosmology. Transcending them restores wholeness.",
