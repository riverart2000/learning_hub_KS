      "hint": "Break the compound: 'Śakti' + 'upāya'.",

      "explanation": "Śakti is not separate from Śiva but is His inherent power of self-expression, will (icchā), knowledge (jñāna), and action (kriyā). Without Śakti, Śiva would be inert; with Her, the universe unfolds as a free play (līlā) of consciousness.",

      "explanation": "The three upāyas are: (1) Śāmbhavopāya (pure will, instantaneous recognition), (2) Śāktopāya (energy/awareness-based methods), and (3) Āṇavopāya (ritual, body, breath). Śāktopāya is suited for those with strong intellectual and introspective capacity but who still benefit from subtle techniques.",

      "hint": "Unlike Āṇavopāya (body) or Śāmbhavopāya (pure will), this path works through refined mental activity.",
      "explanation": "Śāktopāya engages the *vikalpa* (conceptual thought) as a tool — not to suppress it, but to refine and redirect it toward recognition of its source in pure awareness (cit). The practitioner uses inquiry, mantra, and breath-awareness to dissolve mental fragmentation.",

      "explanation": "In Śāktopāya, *ahaṃkāra* (ego-sense) is not annihilated but *expanded* through recognition. The limited 'I' (*ahaṃkāra*) is a condensed form of the universal 'I' (*aham*). Practice reveals the ego’s essence as Śiva’s self-awareness.",

      "explanation": "All consciousness has two inseparable aspects: *prakāśa* (pure radiance, the 'light' of awareness) and *vimarśa* (the reflective capacity to know 'I am this'). Śakti is vimarśa — the dynamic self-recognition that makes consciousness alive and creative.",

      "explanation": "Svātantrya is the core attribute of the Absolute: unrestricted, spontaneous freedom. The universe arises not from necessity but from divine play (līlā) out of sheer freedom. Śāktopāya awakens the practitioner to their own svātantrya — innate autonomy and creativity.",
